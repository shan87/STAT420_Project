## Team

We are team of four. Please find below our names and Net ID in alphabetical order.

```{r echo = FALSE, result = 'asis'}

## Introduction

### About the Project
This data analysis project is inspired from the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition held in Kaggle.

In this project we will be try to predict the final price of each home, based on the 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

###Data Set

#### Source
 techniques to analyze the data. Below are the details about our dataset.
We are using house prie data available at  https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques . We will use regression

#### Background

The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. 


#### File descriptions

List of files used in the project

- train.csv - the training set
- test.csv - the test set
- data_description.txt - full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here

#### Data fields

## Methods

###Data Analysis

```{r}
## Import test and train data from the files

train = read.csv("train.csv")
test = read.csv("test.csv")

## Checking the number of columns and observation in test and train data

dim(train)
dim(test)

```

From the dimension of test and train data, we could see that the test data has one less column than the train, as the sale price column wont be availble in test data which we will be predicting as part of this project.

## Model Building
- step 0 : Data exploration, cleansing and check for multicollineariaty
- step 1 : Build a additive model with all variables
- step 2 : Use one of the search methode to find out the best model for the additive
- step 3 : check the normal distribution and constant variance assumption
- step 4 : Do predictor or response transformation based on the results of the test in step 3
- step 5 : Finalize the model
- Step 6 : Chek for train and test RMSE
- step 7 : check for leverage and influential observation
- step 8 : Build the model after removing the influential observations(if any) and 
           check the RMSE values
- step 9 : predict the results with the final model

**Note** 
  
  - Everytime we fit the model, we need to check the normal distribution and constant variance assumption

Points to consider 

1. Do we need to check LOOCV?
